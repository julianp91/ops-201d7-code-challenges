What is this repo all about?
This repo is all about ops201
Why are you learning these skills?
I have learned a lot, basically everything I didn't know anything about scripting or how useful and powerful it is.
What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
Especially for me in ops201 everything has been a learning process since day one.
What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?
I feel like if every single Ops Challenge was challenging and a learning process on every single one that's why every Ops Challenge is unique. 
How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?
I feel like this course in general is taking you to a workplace. It doesn't feel like school, every work, every lab feels like a workplace scenario which makes it completely useful.
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?
I will improve every single one since the 1st script I have done brought my attention and I will be practicing all of them to get better.
What aspect of your shell scripting skills do you hope to improve next?
I hope I can get better at all of them. This 201 really intrudes me on something that I really want to learn and get better at it. Now I know how powerful and useful they are.
